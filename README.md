#Greeny — AI-Powered Waste Segregation & Recycling Platform

Greeny is an AI-driven waste segregation and recycling platform designed to solve India’s waste management challenges by educating citizens, optimizing recyclers, and enabling data-driven smart cities.
The platform uses computer vision, gamification, and analytics to improve waste segregation at source and make recycling more efficient and profitable.
This project is a demo version of our main idea, built to showcase the core concept and basic workflow.
The full version will include additional features, better UI, and optimizations.

#Problem Statement
India generates 150,000+ tonnes of waste daily, yet less than 30% is properly segregated.

Key Challenges:
Households lack awareness about waste segregation
Waste collection is inefficient and unoptimized
Recyclers receive mixed, low-value waste
